# Tumblr Basic Integration

Just an example of how to use the Tumblr Gem from https://github.com/mwunsch/tumblr

You will need to include a file in ~/.tumblr with the generated OAuth tokens (not included in this project!!).  
You will want to create a new Tumblr Account as appropriate and generate tokens for it. 
The docs for this in the tumblr gem it is quite nice.
